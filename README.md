###Write a program that will determine the type of a triangle. 
It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene

####Development Steps
I started through TDD and following SOLID principles, writing simple tests and make it pass. Basically my first test/impl was about equilateral, isosceles and then scalene.
After that I added some validations regarding the input(a,b,c) when it should be greater then zero.

I tried make this challenge as simple as possible.
